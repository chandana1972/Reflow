
Reflow
=======

You've always dreamed of designing your boards using SMD components?
You want to enter the world of microcontrollers and ICs in QFP, LGA, LQFP, TQFP, SOIC, SOT or BGA package ...?

This board will allow you to use a technique used by professional called reflow soldering.
You just hook up any mini-oven cooking and put the card on. It will drive the oven and allow temperature control for strict compliance curve requirements for the production of printed circuits surface mount technology.

Once reflow is complete, the buzzer will beep to warn you that the solder is complete, and require you to open the oven door.
Then, the cooling of the board can begin. After a few minutes, your components will be brazed and your prototype ready for use ...

Runs on a freescale's microcontroller with boot loader pre-loaded and the system code.
However, you can create the control system yourself and control the LCD, read the buttons and temperature, control the leds, debugging output via USB connector and toggle the power relay. 
An app is included with this kit to visualize the curve of the oven temperature in real time (USB)..
